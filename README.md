# Weather-Application
This application is only for location based response through GPS. Fetching data from OpenWeatherMap formatted as JSON. In the query string, we pass the Latitude, Longitude and the imperial system the results should be in. Using the HttpURLConnection class to make the remote request. Making two requests, one for the current location weather and the other for the five day forecast.
